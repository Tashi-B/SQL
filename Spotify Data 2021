-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert the Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

-- First, I donwloaded the data and created a table. 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

-- Then, I inserted the Spotify data .csv into a the table

-- Next, I explored the data using the following SQL

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

-- Determining the 10 most popular artists based on popularity and how danceable are each song. 
SELECT artist_name, popularity, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 90
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Average tempo among Spotify Song Data
SELECT ROUND(AVG(tempo), 2) as avg_tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

-- Top 10 longest Spotify tracks
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 10;

--Out of the 50 songs, which artists appear more than once
SELECT artist_name,
 COUNT(artist_name) as pop_artist_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING pop_artist_count >1
ORDER BY pop_artist_count DESC;

--Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
--Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, 
--their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS(
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) as popularity_average
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name)

SELECT artist_name, 
popularity_average, 
'Top Star' as Tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE 
WHERE popularity_average >=90
ORDER BY popularity_average DESC;
